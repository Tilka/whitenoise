whitenoise ChangeLog
---------------------------------------------------------------

v 1.0.2

09/25/10  --  Fix a number of possible buffer overflows,
              check errors more rigorously, etc.


v 1.0.1

02/13/04  --  Fix for linking failure on some platforms.


v 1.0

02/11/04  --  Updated documentation.

01/15/04  --  Added an option to change the latency.  The
              default latency is decreased to 200ms, which
              feels pretty responsive when changing audio
              characteristics dynamically.

01/14/04  --  Added the ability to generate plots of the
              filter frequency response, using gnuplot(1).

              Added native aRts support.

01/08/04  --  Implemented the ability to read commands from
              stdin, in realtime.


v 0.3

01/07/04  --  Added the -r RATE option.

01/07/04  --  Shortened the /dev/dsp sample blocksize.  The
              previous setting did not work properly at least
              with the i810_audio driver.

              Thanks to jj Behrens <jjinux@yahoo.com> for the 
              bug report and patch.


v 0.2

04/09/02  --  Added the fade option.

              Added a choice of five standard windowed-FIR 
              lowpass filters.  (Blackman, Bartlett, Hanning, 
              Hamming, Rectangular)
